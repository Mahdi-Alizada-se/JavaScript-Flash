# Javascript Flash

Small, static project for practicing DOM and JSON with a VR headset gallery.

## How to open

- Open `index.html` in your browser.
- Or serve locally (recommended for JSON):

```bash
# from project root
You can see the Project [here](https://mahdi-alizada-se.github.io/JavaScript-Flash/)

# then open http://localhost:8000
```

## Files

- `index.html` — site entry
- `main.css` — styles
- `main.js` — loads JSON and renders gallery/products
- `assets/` — images and JSON data

## Data

- `assets/json/gallery.json` — gallery items (image, title)
- `assets/json/products.json` — product list (id, name, price, image)

That's it — simple and ready for small experiments.
